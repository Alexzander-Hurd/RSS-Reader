## üß† About The Project

This project is a flexible and extensible tool for aggregating and reading content from a variety of sources:

- Traditional RSS (XML-based)
- JSON Feeds (modern feed standard)
- JSON APIs (with schema mapping)
- Webhook event payloads (GitHub, CI/CD, etc.)

It is modular by design and supports custom plugin development for alternative feed types, transformations, and UI integrations.
